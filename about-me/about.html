    <h1>My Story So Far...</h1>
    <div class="middle-container">
        <div class="center par">
            <p>
            My passion for computing began as a middle schooler's dream to play more
            modular video games, where the the content of a video game is only limited
            by its community and the hardware it runs on. After building my first
            computer in the 8th grade, solving technical problems became a way of
            life. There were days that I would spend almost the entirety of sifting
            through forum posts for similar problems or looking up what the purpose
            was for an advanced setting in an application in order to get it running
            again or because it wasn't running smoothly. These experiences became the
            headstart I needed when I began working as a technician for Repair
            Authority, which is now the largest home medical equipment repair provider
            in the U.S.
            </p>

            <p>
            Repair technician work seriously honed my troubleshooting and diagnostic
            skills. Every day I worked with skilled individuals that offered their
            techniques to those who were serious about improvement, and seeing other
            technician's do the impossible, like conquering 1 hour repair jobs in 25
            minutes, was an incredible source of motivation. While I did eventually
            become a very skilled technician, I also learned the importance of work
            ethic and community; becoming a skilled technician would have never been
            possible if it weren't for the skilled individuals that valued their work
            and their willingness to welcome others with the same values. After about
            2 years, I knew my work as a medical equipment repair technician could
            only bring me so far, as my true ambition is to work in either software
            development or IT.
            </p>
            <p>
            I started my computer science degree journey at Cuyahoga Community
            College, where I took my general education courses and a few programming
            courses. At Cleveland State University, I learned far more about
            computing, and the advanced topics gave me the foundation and confidence
            needed to handle difficult areas of the industry, such as abstraction
            hierarchies in computer architecture, low-level and systems programming,
            etc.
            </p>

            <p class="extra">
            Now, my goal is to work for a team that shares my strong values of
            commitment, shared-growth, and community.
