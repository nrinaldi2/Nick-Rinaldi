      <h1>Nick's Story So Far...</h1>
      <div class="center par">
        <h3>Introduction to Computing</h3>
        <p class="first">
          My passion for computing began as a middle schooler's dream to play
          more modular video games that could be expanded on and modified in
          ways that are only limited by a game's community and the hardware it
          runs on.
          <span class="highlight"
            >After building my first computer in the 8th grade, solving
            technical problems became a way of life.</span
          >
          There were days that I would spend almost the entirety of sifting
          through forum posts for similar problems or looking up what the
          purpose was for an advanced setting in an application in order to get
          it running again or because it wasn't running smoothly. These
          experiences became the headstart I needed when I began working as a
          technician for Repair Authority, which is now the largest home medical
          equipment repair provider in the U.S.
        </p>

        <h3>Learning Workplace Maturity</h3>
        <p>
          Repair technician work seriously honed my troubleshooting and
          diagnostic skills. Every day I worked with skilled individuals that
          offered their techniques to those who were serious about improvement,
          and seeing other technician's do the impossible, like conquering 1
          hour repair jobs in 25 minutes, was an incredible source of
          motivation.
          <span class="highlight"
            >While I did eventually become a very capable technician, I also
            learned the importance of work ethic and community;</span
          >
          learning to expertly and efficiently handle high skill ceiling, niche
          work such as medical equipment repair would have never been possible
          if it weren't for the people around me that valued their work and
          their willingness to welcome others with the same values. After about
          2 years, I knew my work as a medical equipment repair technician could
          only bring me so far, as my true ambition is to work in either
          software development or IT.
        </p>

        <h3>Path to Professionalism</h3>
        <p>
          I started my computer science degree journey at Cuyahoga Community
          College, where I took my general education courses and a few
          programming courses. At Cleveland State University, I learned far more
          about computing, and
          <span class="highlight"
            >the advanced topics gave me the foundation and confidence needed to
            handle difficult areas of the industry</span
          >, such as abstraction hierarchies in computer architecture, low-level
          and systems programming, etc.
        </p>

        <h3 class="last">Career Aspiration in Focus</h3>
        <p>
          Now, my goal is to work for a well-coordinated team that shares my
          strong values of <span class="highlight">commitment</span>,
          <span class="highlight">shared-growth</span>, and
          <span class="highlight">community</span>.
