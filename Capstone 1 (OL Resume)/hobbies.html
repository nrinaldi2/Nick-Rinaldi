    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Music Production</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite, most time consuming hobby is producing music using a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) 
        called FL Studio. While not advanced by any means, I have been obsessed with learning how to create 
        unique synthesizer sounds and arrange Electronic Dance Music (EDM) since I started in 2020. If you're 
        brave enough to endure it, you can find some of my work on SoundCloud.com under the name Lankorde.
    </p>

    <h2>Home Improvement</h2>
    <p>
        When I'm not producing music, I'm usually finding something in my house to work on. Nothing as large-scale as 
        renovating entire rooms, but if I can save some shelf space by mounting my TV on the wall, you bet I'll do it.
    </p>

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>
        Video games used to be my favorite time waster. However, as I got older (and busier), there became much less time
        to waste. So, only occasionally you'll find me everlastingly-consumed by a power trip in Civilization 5 or the
        newest Doom release.
